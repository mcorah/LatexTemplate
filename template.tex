\section{Sage tutorial}
Inline sage looks like $5^2=\sage{5^2}$

How about a derivative?
\begin{align}
  \frac{d}{dx}\tan^{-1}x = \sage{derivative(atan(x),x)}
\end{align}

Or a block of sage:
\begin{sageblock}
  f(x) = integrate(sin(x)*cos(x), x)
\end{sageblock}
\begin{align}
  \sage{f(x)}
\end{align}

Now how about we plot something (or really the previous function)?
See Figure \ref{fig:sage}.\\

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{ \sageplot[scale=0.5]{plot(f, -2*pi, 2*pi)} }
  \caption{A plot of $f=\protect\sage{f(x)}$}
  \label{fig:sage}
\end{figure}

I can also do things silently
\begin{sagesilent}
  g(x) = 0
\end{sagesilent}
